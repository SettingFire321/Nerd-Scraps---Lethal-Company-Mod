Nerd Scraps
V1.0.2
By SettingFire321 (Keyble)

This mod adds some fun new scraps to the game that you can collect and sell (or decorate ;D). These scraps come from popular franchises like Mario and Every scrap has a chance to spawn on EVERY VANILLA moon and Lethal Expansion's Wateridge. Every scrap has their own sound when interacted with!

[List of Scraps] -------------------------------------------

C = Conductive
2 = 2 Hands

    - GameCube (2 Variants) - C
    - Question Mark Block - C 2
    - Wii Remote
    - Poké Ball - C
    - Mario Kart Wii Star Cup Trophies (3 Variants) - All C & 2
-----------------------------------------------------------

[Version History] --------------------------------------
V1.0.2 
- Added a new Gamecube white variant (worth the same)
- Fixed an issue where the [poke ball] was slightly in the air when resting
- Every scrap can now be seen on Wateridge
- Slightly increased [question mark block]'s spawn rate
- Decreased spawn rates of [Star Cup Trophy Silver] and [Star Cup Trophy Gold] for balancing purposes.
- Fix a problem where the player model uses 1 hand for 2-handed scraps. This screwed up with the holding positions so it might looks a bit off in game

[Known Issues] --------------------------------------
     - Wii Remote Button textures are a little miscolored. No idea how to fix this (yet???) but it should not be THAT noticeable I think... :^)
     - The pegs on the ? Blocks are yellow, not white. Hopefully that doesn't bother you! Wait, you weren't going to notice until I brought it up? Oh... whoops :D
