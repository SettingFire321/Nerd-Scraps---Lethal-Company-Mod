Nerd Scraps

V1.1.4

By SettingFire321 (Keyble)

This mod adds some fun new scraps to the game that you can collect and sell (or decorate ;D). These scraps come from popular franchises like Mario and Every scrap has a chance to spawn on EVERY VANILLA moon and Lethal Expansion's Wateridge. Every scrap has their own sound when grabbed/dropped!

[Version History]

V1.1.4
- Fixed a MAJOR issue where the newest batch of items (except for the [Master Sword]) had their spawn rates overwritten to 100 (which is BAD)
- Added the [Ring] from Sonic as an apology

--

V1.1.1
- [Super Mushroom] now acts as a whoopie cushion. Going over it will play the power up sound
- Changed the [Smash Trophy BASE] to have a universal spawn weight of 1 so it should work on ALL planets included modded ones
- Changed the [Smash Trophy KIRBY] to have a universal spawn weight of 4 so it should work on ALL planets included modded ones

--

V1.1.0
- Added:
     - Master Sword
          - Damage = shovel x 2 (Could be lowered later)! Can 3 shot nut crackers. SUPER HEAVY. You are going to need 2 hands for this as you are NOT built like the Hero of TIme!
     - Super Mushroom
     - Smash Bros. Trophy Base
          - ONLY the base of the trophy. Worth NOTHING! Weights 1 lb! Spawn rate LOWEST in the mod! Only good for loot but bait and other survival but that's it! If you see anything else valuable, get that instead!
     - Smash Bros. Trophy Kirby
          - A trophy of an unknown pink alien. Doesn't look too strong...
     - Toad (BUP!)
          - Plays a sound on left click (BUP!). Entities around you can hear him so BUP with caution!
     - Yoshi Egg
          -  A cute egg! Pretty heavy! What could be inside? I think I can hear something!

- Bug Fixes:
     - For balancing purposes and because there are more scraps being added, the value of [Wii Remote] has been lowered by a little bit
     - Improved how the player grabs the [Wii Remote]

- Others:
     - Removed screenshots folder from installation folder as it took up space. Pictures are still on GitHub

--

V1.0.2 
- Added a new Gamecube white variant (worth the same)
- Fixed an issue where the [poke ball] was slightly in the air when resting
- Every scrap can now be seen on Wateridge
- Slightly increased [question mark block]'s spawn rate
- Decreased spawn rates of [Star Cup Trophy Silver] and [Star Cup Trophy Gold] for balancing purposes.
- Fixed a problem where the player model uses 1 hand for 2-handed scraps. This screwed up with the holding positions so it might looks a bit off in game

V1.0.0 
- RELEASED
- None of the scraps are interactable (yet???)
- These items will NOT spawn on modded moons (yet???)
- Added:
     - GameCube
     - Wii Remote
     - Mario ? Block
     - Poké Ball
     - Mario Kart Wii Star Cup Trophies
          - 3 Variants:
               - 3rd Place Bronze (Common)
               - 2nd Place Silver (Rare)
               - 1st Place Gold (SUPER DUPER RARE OMG)
----------------------------------------------------

[Next Version Plans]

- More trophies?
- More gag scraps?
----------------------------------------------------

[Things to Know]

- Heads up, pick up sounds MAY be loud. Don't be startled!
- [Toad] looks very scary with the game filter :)
- There is a gag item with the Smash [trophies]. You can either get the base or an actual trophy. The base version is worth nothing while everything else is
- The [Master Sword] charge up is quite long. You don't have to wait until the audio is over for max damage
- The pitch of [Toad]'s "BUP!" is determined by the pitch of the last manual "BUP!"
----------------------------------------------------

[Known Issues]

- [Wii Remote] Button textures are a little discolored. No idea how to fix this (yet???) but it should not be THAT noticeable I think... :^)
- The pegs on the [Question Mark Block] are yellow, not white. Hopefully that doesn't bother you! Wait, you weren't going to notice until I brought it up? Oh... whoops :D
- Small items such as the [Poke Ball] can sometimes spawn in places such that they become ungrabbable
- [Toad]'s "BUP" can reach pitches so low, the earth's crack under pressure. The "min pitch" setting doesn't work on my end. Most likely will later
