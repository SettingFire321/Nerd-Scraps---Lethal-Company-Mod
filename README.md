This mod adds some fun new scraps to the game that you can collect and sell (or decorate ;D). Every scrap has a chance to spawn on EVERY VANILLA moon. Every scrap has their own sound when interacted with!

List of Scraps :

( C = Conductive )

( 2 = 2 Handed Item )

- GameCube - C
- Question Mark Block - C 2
- Wii Remote
- Poké Ball - C
- Mario Kart Wii Star Cup Trophies (3 Variants) - All C & 2
